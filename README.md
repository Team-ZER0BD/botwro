Here we have the Dumbbot1.0, built to function perfectly on the WRO FE field, either with or without obstacles. Simulating analog sensors and OpenCV, the model car has enough features to drive itself around the field track for a few laps. 


Sonar sensor HC-Sr04 was used to finely identify the FE track's walls. As this category of sensors has a very narrow identifying range, we used one in the front and the other two inclined on both sides of our car. 

The Raspberry pi 3b+ version with a storage capacity of 32 GB- The microcontroller board can quickly and easily tell the difference between the red and green blocks and function accordingly.  

Camera module: Given our microcontroller board, Raspberry pi, we intended to use the raspberry pi camera module 2 as it suits just perfectly for the purpose. The camera integrated with the Raspberry Pi was calibrated to smoothly detect the motion of the red and green blocks while moving. 

Motor drivercl298n- an introductory resource for every new robotics enthusiast out there. This simple motor driver was set up to control both the motor on our back wheels and the steering motor on our front wheels.

The Motion sensor 10 DOF IMU Sensor (B) is good at motion monitor, developed to detect and measure the position, height, and temperature while scorching the field track. __________, as it provides great man-machine interaction. 

Arduino Uno and proto shield - another basic robotic essential used here to control our motor drivers and put the whole thing together.

Due to the unavailability of most of the durable robotics equipment in our country, we had to build the autonomous car with everything we could manage. With our goal to smoothly navigate around the field, we minimized the velocity to the able amount.
